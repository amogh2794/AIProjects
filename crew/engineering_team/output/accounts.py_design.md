# Detailed Design for `accounts.py` Python Module

This module provides the implementation for a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. It includes all necessary classes and functions to create an account, deposit and withdraw funds, manage portfolio transactions, and calculate portfolio values and profits/losses.

## Module: `accounts.py`

### Class: `Account`

**Attributes:**
- `user_id`: Unique identifier for the user.
- `balance`: Current available fund balance for the user.
- `holdings`: Dictionary with share symbols as keys and quantities as values representing the user's holdings.
- `transactions`: List storing all transaction records including time, type, symbol, quantity, and transaction amount.
- `initial_deposit`: Amount of the first deposit made in the account.

**Methods:**

- `__init__(self, user_id: str) -> None`
  - Initializes a new account for a user with the given `user_id`.
  - Sets initial balance to 0, empty holdings, empty transaction list and initial deposit to 0.

- `deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`
  - Deposits the specified `amount` into the user's account balance.
  - Updates `initial_deposit` during the first deposit.
  - Appends deposit transaction to the transaction list.

- `withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool`
  - Attempts to withdraw the specified `amount` from the user's account if sufficient funds are available.
  - Returns `True` if successful; otherwise `False`.
  - Appends withdrawal transaction to the transaction list.

- `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int, get_share_price: callable) -> bool`
  - Attempts to purchase the specified `quantity` of shares with `symbol`.
  - Uses `get_share_price(symbol)` to obtain the current price.
  - Checks if the account balance is sufficient for the transaction.
  - Updates holdings and appends a buy transaction to the transaction list.
  - Returns `True` if successful; otherwise `False`.

- `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int, get_share_price: callable) -> bool`
  - Attempts to sell the specified `quantity` of shares with `symbol`.
  - Uses `get_share_price(symbol)` to find the current price.
  - Checks if the sufficient shares are available in holdings.
  - Updates holdings and balance, appends a sell transaction to the transaction list.
  - Returns `True` if successful; otherwise `False`.

- `calculate_total_value(self, get_share_price: callable) -> float`
  - Calculates and returns the total value of the user's account (balance + portfolio value).
  - Portfolio value is calculated using current share prices obtained via `get_share_price(symbol)`.

- `calculate_profit_or_loss(self, get_share_price: callable) -> float`
  - Calculates and returns the profit or loss based on initial deposit.
  - Uses `calculate_total_value` to determine current total value.

- `get_holdings(self) -> dict`
  - Returns a summary of the user's current holdings.

- `get_transaction_history(self) -> list`
  - Returns a list of all transactions performed by the user.

- `get_profit_or_loss_statement(self, get_share_price: callable) -> str`
  - Returns a formatted string detailing the user's current profit or loss state.

### Function: `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`
- A mock function to simulate getting current prices of shares.
- It returns fixed prices for `AAPL`, `TSLA`, `GOOGL` for ease of testing.

Note: This design provides a clear path to implement business logic and functionality required for managing user accounts and trading simulation on the platform.

This design ensures everything is well encapsulated in a single module, making it ready for further development, testing, and integration into larger systems.
